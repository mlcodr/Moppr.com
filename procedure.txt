Moppr — Modern Frontend-Only Prototype (No Backend)

Goal
- Build a highly polished, dynamic, and modern UI prototype for a maid finder platform (Moppr) with: Login/Signup (mock), Search and Filters, Skills, Ratings/Reviews, Booking (dates/times), Confirmation/Cancellation, and In-app Messaging (mock). No server — pure frontend with mock data and local persistence.

Tech Stack
1) Framework: React + Vite (fast dev, modern toolchain)
2) Styling: Tailwind CSS + CSS variables for theming
3) Animations: Framer Motion (micro-interactions, page transitions)
4) Icons: Lucide or Heroicons
5) State: React Context + Zustand (lightweight and simple), localStorage for persistence
6) Routing: React Router
7) Date/Time: React Day Picker or React Date Range + native time inputs
8) Mock Data: JSON files; optional MirageJS or MSW to simulate API calls

Information Architecture (Pages & Key Screens)
- Landing/Home: Hero, value props, animated search bar, featured maids, testimonials
- Auth: Login/Signup modals (mock); Google/Email buttons; validates inputs only
- Browse/Search: Grid of maid cards, filters (location, price, skills, availability, rating), optional static map image
- Maid Profile: Large hero, photos carousel, skills chips, rating summary, reviews list, CTA to "Request Service"
- Booking Flow: Drawer/Modal with date picker, time slots, price estimate, confirmation; show cancellation rules
- Messages: Two-pane UI (thread list + chat), typing indicator, send message (stored locally)
- Account (optional for prototype): Bookings list, messages, saved maids, profile settings

Design System
- Color: Vibrant accent gradient (teal -> indigo) with dark mode toggle
- Typography: Inter or Satoshi; generous white space, large headings
- Components: Buttons (primary/ghost), Inputs, Selects, Chips, Toggles, Cards, Modals/Drawers, Tabs, Toasts, Avatars, Rating Stars, Empty States
- Spacing & Elevation: Soft shadows, glassmorphism touches for panels, hover/press feedback

Core Components (Reusable)
- AppShell (top nav, sidebar on desktop, footer)
- HeroSearch (animated, expands to advanced filters)
- MaidCard (image, name, skills chips, rating, price, availability badge)
- FilterBar (skills multi-select, rating slider, price range, availability)
- SkillsChips (selectable, animated)
- RatingStars (read/write for mock review submission)
- DateTimePicker (date + time; validation on conflicts)
- BookingDrawer (steps: details -> times -> confirm)
- ReviewList and ReviewComposer (mock submit)
- Chat (thread list + message bubble list + composer; local echo)
- Modal/Drawer/Toast primitives

Data Model (Mock)
- maid: { id, name, avatar, location, hourlyRate, skills[], ratingAvg, ratingCount, availability[], bio, gallery[] }
- review: { id, maidId, user, rating, text, createdAt }
- booking: { id, maidId, userId, date, startTime, endTime, status: requested|confirmed|cancelled }
- message: { id, threadId, senderId, text, createdAt, read }
- thread: { id, maidId, userId, lastMessageAt }

State & Persistence
- Global store (Zustand) for user session (mock), filters, booking draft, messages
- Persist slices to localStorage: user, bookings, messages, favorites
- Simulate latency with small timeouts to make UI feel realistic

Feature Walkthrough
1) Login/Signup (Mock)
   - Open modal from navbar
   - Validate fields; on success, store mock user in localStorage
   - Show toasts and animated success checkmark

2) Search & Filter
   - HeroSearch on Home; deep link to /browse with query params
   - FilterBar collapsible on mobile; sticky on desktop
   - Animated chips for skills; rating slider; price range; availability toggle
   - Show count of results; skeleton loaders while filtering

3) Skills
   - Display skills as colored chips with tooltips
   - Multi-select filter; highlight on hover; filter logic runs client-side

4) Ratings & Reviews
   - MaidCard shows ratingAvg + count
   - Profile shows distribution bars; ReviewList with infinite scroll (mock)
   - ReviewComposer allows adding a review (adds to local state)

5) Request Service
   - BookingDrawer from Profile and Card CTA
   - Select date (calendar) and time window; validate against maid availability
   - Price estimator: duration x hourlyRate; show breakdown

6) Confirmation & Cancellation
   - Confirmation screen with confetti animation; booking added to local store
   - Bookings tab with status chips; allow cancel -> status updates, show toast

7) In-App Messaging (Mock)
   - Messages page: thread list left, conversation right
   - New message animates in; typing indicator; unread badge logic in store

Delight & Motion
- Page transitions and shared element transitions (Framer Motion)
- Micro-interactions: button taps, filter chip toggles, card hover tilt
- Skeletons for loading, empty states with illustrations
- Dark mode with smooth theme transition

Accessibility & Quality
- Keyboard navigable modals/drawers; focus traps
- ARIA labels for interactive components
- Color contrast checked; prefers-reduced-motion support
- Responsive from 360px -> 1440px+; test in Chrome/Edge and mobile emulation

Routing Structure
- /
- /browse?query=&skills=&priceMin=&priceMax=&rating=&availability=
- /maid/:id
- /messages
- /account/bookings (optional)

Project Structure
- src/
  - main.tsx, app.css, tailwind.css
  - routes/ (Home.tsx, Browse.tsx, Profile.tsx, Messages.tsx)
  - components/ (global primitives + feature components)
  - store/ (userStore.ts, bookingStore.ts, messagesStore.ts, filtersStore.ts)
  - data/ (maids.json, reviews.json, availability.json)
  - utils/ (formatters, date utils, storage)
  - assets/ (logos, illustrations)

Build Steps (You can follow or I can implement)
1) Initialize: Vite + React + TS; add Tailwind, Framer Motion, React Router, Zustand
2) Set up Tailwind theme, fonts, color variables, dark mode
3) Build AppShell and navigation with auth modal
4) Implement Home with HeroSearch and featured maids
5) Create Browse page: FilterBar + MaidGrid + skeletons
6) Create Profile page: gallery, skills, reviews, BookingDrawer
7) Implement booking store, validation, price estimator
8) Implement Messages with local threads and bubbles
9) Add toasts, empty states, animations, and polish
10) QA on responsiveness, accessibility, and local persistence

Repository Structure & Hosting (GitHub-ready)
- Root files
  - README.md (project overview + run/deploy guide)
  - procedure.txt (this plan)
  - package.json (scripts: dev, build, preview)
  - vite.config.ts
  - tailwind.config.ts, postcss.config.js
  - index.html (Vite entry)
  - .gitignore (node_modules, dist)
  - .nvmrc (optional Node LTS version)
  - public/ (static assets)
- src/
  - main.tsx, App.tsx
  - routes/, components/, store/, data/, utils/, assets/

.gitignore (minimum)
- node_modules/
- dist/
- .DS_Store
- *.log

Git & GitHub
1) git init
2) git add . && git commit -m "chore: scaffold Moppr UI"
3) Create a new GitHub repo and set remote:
   - git remote add origin https://github.com/<you>/moppr.git
   - git branch -M main
   - git push -u origin main

Hosting Options
- GitHub Pages (recommended for static Vite)
  - In vite.config.ts set base: "/moppr/" (repo name)
  - npm run build -> outputs to dist
  - Push to main; enable Pages (Deploy from /docs or use gh-pages action)
  - Or use gh-pages package:
    - npm i -D gh-pages
    - Add scripts: "predeploy": "npm run build", "deploy": "gh-pages -d dist"
    - npm run deploy

- Vercel/Netlify (easiest)
  - Import GitHub repo
  - Framework preset: Vite
  - Build command: npm run build
  - Output directory: dist
  - Auto previews on PRs; custom domain support

Environment Notes
- No .env required (frontend-only). If adding keys later, use Vite env (VITE_*) and never commit secrets.

Naming & Conventions
- Use kebab-case for files, PascalCase for React components
- Co-locate component-specific styles
- Keep mock data in src/data and images in public/assets or src/assets
